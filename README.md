# Restaurant-Administration-Database-Management-System
The Database is designed in a way that both the Admin and the User can access the database management system and according to their needs and requirements, the functions have been designed.
The first database stores the information of the user where details like username, phone numbers, email id and address have been stored and a membership card is issued. The number written on this membership card is also stored in the same database. The data store hence helps the authority to contact their user and study them.
The second database that has been made is the employee database where details of the employee are stored.
